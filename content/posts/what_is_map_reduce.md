## What is Map Reduce?
> Map Reduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets. It is a distributed computing framework that allows processing of large datasets in a distributed manner across multiple nodes. It is used for processing large datasets that cannot fit into a single machine's memory.

简单来说，MapReduce是一种编程模型和一种关联的实现，用于处理和生成大型数据集。它是一个分布式计算框架，允许在多个节点上以分布式的方式处理大型数据集。它用于处理无法容纳在单个机器内存中的大型数据集。
